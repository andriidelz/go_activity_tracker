<!-- add linters (golang-ci.yaml)
 
- add integration tests with testcontainers-go library

- end to end tests - i dont know how to do, just have imagination about it. Dont do 'em -->

<!-- - add makefile - done!!!

- improve docker compose yaml, and review dockerfile

- todo function Events per action type → count by(action)
Circus : 5

User : 4 actions created by him -> it is what you have now
you might also want to add this:
Podcast : 20 ; so it means, there are 20 podcast events in your db
Events per action type → count by(action) optionally

Additionally, you can track system metrics: CPU, memory, DB connections, etc. — these are optional but useful for infrastructure monitoring.

- rename Action to other appropriate word. 

- add Readme.md as per example, descriptive text how to run your app, and other things by your wish
